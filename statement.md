# VIT-Lost-Found

## Problem Statement & Project Scope

### 1. Problem Statement
On a campus as lively as ours, keeping track of personal belongings can be a challenge. Currently, when we lose something valuable like an ID card or phone, we rely on disorganised methods like word-of-mouth or scattered whatsApp chats. This leads to:
* **Missed Connections:** Items are found, but the owners never find the post.
* **Trust Issues:** Without a proper verification system, handing over a found item feels risky.
* **Information Overload:** We see the same 'Lost ID' photo forwarded again and again, making it harder to spot the important updates.

### 2. Project Scope
**VIT Lost & Found** is a centralized python based application designed to bridge the gap between the "Finder" and the "Loser" of an item. The system utilises cloud-based storage to ensure data is accessible across different instances and provides a secure verification to prevent theft.

### 3. Target Users
* **Students:** To report lost items or claim found ones.
* **Faculty & Staff:** To report items found in classrooms or labs.
* **Campus Security/Proctors:** To manage the handover of valuable items.

### 4. High-Level Features
* **Cloud Powered:** Data is stored online, not stuck on one device.
* **Secure:** Only registered users can report or claim items.
* **Smart Verification:** Our "Distinction Match" feature uses AI-like logic to verify ownership automatically based on hidden item details.
* **Live Dashboard:** Keeps the list updated by showing only unclaimed items.
